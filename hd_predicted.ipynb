    "Data exploration is a crucial step in the data analysis process. This phase allows for understanding the nature of the data, identifying trends, patterns, and laying the groundwork for more in-depth analyses. Here are some steps and techniques commonly used during data exploration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understanding the Data: start by examining basic data features such as dataset size, variable types, and the initial rows to gain an initial overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Descriptive Statistics: calculate descriptive statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, etc., to get an idea of the distribution of numerical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualization: Use graphs to visualize the data. Histograms, box plots, and scatter plots are useful for understanding the distribution, dispersion, and relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Correlation Analysis: explore the relationships between variables by calculating correlations. This can reveal interesting associations or potential collinearities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Segmentation: if the data allows, perform segmentation to identify homogeneous subgroups. This can help tailor analyses based on specific characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preliminary Statistical Tests: if needed, conduct preliminary statistical tests to assess normality, equality of variances, etc."
